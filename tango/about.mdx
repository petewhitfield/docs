## Welcome to Tango

Tango is designed to smartly extract, associate, and export data from a variety of files, including:

- Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)
- Engineering drawings
- Equipment tags and instrumentation details
- Line numbers
- Form PDFs
- Tables embedded in PDFs
- Title blocks on engineering drawings
- Photos of signs or nameplates

## Key Features

### Document Processing

- Upload and process documents such as P&IDs, engineering drawings, U1 forms, and more.
- Extract details like drawing specifics, tags (equipment/instrumentation), line numbers, and table data.

<Tip>
  For larger files (e.g., PDFs with \>1,000 pages), upload overnight for processing efficiency.
</Tip>

### Data Management

- View documents and edit extracted data to ensure accuracy.
- Search for specific information within files.
- Export data in various formats, such as Excel.

### Custom Jobs & Customer Records

- Users can create jobs tailored to specific data extraction needs and associate them with customer records.

<Tip>
  Add customers before creating a job.
</Tip>

### Advanced Editing Tools

• Handle missing or unextracted data by manually assigning and refining data points, such as equipment or instrument tags.

<Tip>
  Files "Under Review" can still be opened while the app addresses the issues flagged during extraction.
</Tip>

### File Compatibility

• Tango works with PDFs but does not currently support Word or Excel files.

## Installation

Tango can be installed through the Edge browser by visiting the <span class="blue-link">[Tango Setup](https://sttangodev001.blob.core.windows.net/tango-setup/setup.html)</span> page and completing a guided installation process. It supports seamless login integration via eagle.org credentials.

## Future Enhancements (Planned Features)

Planned features include:

- Expanding P&ID extraction capabilities, such as line number pattern searches across job files, valve extraction, and stream number extraction (PFD)
- Improved document management tools for page handling and embedded OCR text export
