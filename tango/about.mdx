### Data Management

\
• View documents and edit extracted data to ensure accuracy.\
• Search for specific information within files.\
• Export data in various formats, such as Excel.

### Custom Jobs & Customer Records

\
• Users can create jobs tailored to specific data extraction needs and associate them with customer records.
