There are three categories of use permissions to be aware of:

   Special categories of data which are regulated by law, which we are never permitted to use in this tool include:
   - Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
   - ITAR or other Export Restricted Data
   - Government Classified Data (any level of classification)
   - If the client has accepted the current ABS T&Cs, without modification, then use is permitted
   - If the contract is on client paper, please check with legal
2. **Sometimes permitted for use**
   - Whether or not we can use client data in this tool will be governed by the terms of the applicable client contract. Additionally, the contract may permit some forms of use within the tool, but not others
3. **Always permitted for use**
   - It is always permissible to use ABS intellectual property or internal data in this tool
   - HOWEVER, please be sure that the data in question is in fact ABS data. If the data was produced in the performance of a client contract, then it may be considered client data. Please check with legal if you are unsure
