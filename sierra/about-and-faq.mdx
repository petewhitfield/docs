## What is Sierra?

Sierra is an AI chat assistant designed to support the employees of ABS. The Technology Team developed Sierra to provide employees with secure access to private large-language models (LLMs). Wherever feasible, we will identify opportunities to expand Sierra's capabilities in ways that are specific to our operations and expertise.
