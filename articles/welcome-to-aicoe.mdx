This site exists to accelerate, guide, and consolidate the use of AI tools across ABS. The intended audience is threefold:

- Frontline staff who want access to AI-powered tools
- Coders who want to tap into production-ready AI models, agents, and knowledge repos
- ABS leadership who want to see what we're doing

If you work with data, models, integrations, or automation inside ABS, this is your source for code, APIs, models, documentation, and release notes — no presentations or marketing content here.

### What you’ll find here

The [portal.absconsulting.com](http://portal.absconsulting.com) website will provide the following content:

- Announcements and release notes: timely posts about new AI services and endpoints, API and SDK updates, model deployments, and deprecations.
- Technical documentation
- Portal API key management
- Links to AI apps, tools, and training
- Blog-style articles for inspiration

### What we're asking for

We hope that this site will help you access the power that AI brings. A few simple asks:

- Try the apps that we build and promote — real adoption surfaces real problems and real wins. (It also helps us manage AI governance!)
- Use the APIs in your solutions. Not a programmer? SIERRA can help you script basic solutions using the APIs without deep coding.
- Tell us what breaks: [[absgtechnology@eagle.org](mailto:absgtechnology@eagle.org)](mailto:[absgtechnology@eagle.org](mailto:absgtechnology@eagle.org)). If something is rough, we need to know — silence slows progress.

### Our Vision for this Site

This site was originally conceived as a hub for ABS Consulting's AI solutions. This scope expanded when Matthew Mowrer was nominated to lead the ABS-wide AI Center of Excellence. The vision remains the same: provide robust, generalized, modular solutions that enable AI-powered operations across the enterprise. AI is everywhere. At the AI Center of Excellence, we invest in best available solutions that we expect to produce a commercial return on investment. In some cases, these solutions may come from external vendors. In other cases, we will build our own. Regardless, we will use this site to help staff find the AI tools they need.

We have many upgrades and releases planned.
