description: "Why should you use our API endpoints? We don't want to be draconian about this—but we really, really want you to use what we've built. Here, we make the case for why you should: what's in it for the company and what's in it for you."

## What’s in it for the company

ABS and its affiliated companies comprise a large business with a complicated revenue model and sometimes opaque cost accounting. For AI, it’s tempting to swipe a credit card or spin up an Azure resource to solve a short‑term need. That behavior compounds existing issues and creates a mess for company management down the line. By using the resources we’ve made available, you help ABS:

- Track costs
- Manage cyber security risks
- Enforce data governance
- Reduce redundant software development effort
- Reduce IT deployment burden

## What’s in it for you

We want to be your easy button for AI. Here’s our plan:

- Small AI compute jobs are free to your business unit—just plug and chug.
- Our endpoints run on production‑grade, IMS‑approved cloud infrastructure—your data will be safe.

  <Warning>
    You still need to be sure that your client has not forbidden use of generative AI!
  </Warning>
- If an endpoint doesn’t do what you need, tell us. You’re probably not the only one. If there’s a clear commercial ROI, we’ll cover reasonable costs to add the features you need.
- We’ll manage server scaling, maintenance, and upgrades.
- As we begin to roll out agents and knowledge repos, you'll be able to tap into these tools using consistent patterns and frameworks.

We're already incorporating user feedback in our next version of the SIERRA API and are rolling out the Documents Service. These endpoints provide core capabilities that should be relevant to many AI workflows.

> Did we mention FREE TOKENS? For the foreseeable future, our endpoints will be free to you. Please use them!

  **A Note on SDKs**

  We haven’t built SDKs for our endpoints. Yes, that might be mildly annoying, but modern AI assistants are excellent at reading an API spec and making HTTP requests in whatever language you use. SIERRA can help if you don’t normally use AI in your coding workflow. If someone builds an SDK and wants to share it, we’ll gladly promote it on this site.
