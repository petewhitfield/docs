Our APIs are safe for ABS intellectual property and internal data, in accordance with the <span class="white-link">[data policy](/sierra/data-policy)</span>. Best of all, these APIs are free to use.

<Tip>
Not a developer? No problem! SIERRA can help you write scripts and run them. If you find an API endpoint that looks useful, hit the "Copy page" button and paste it into your SIERRA chat. 
</Tip>

Please try out our MCP server. Use the dropdown next to "Copy" to add our MCP server to Cursor or any other MCP client you have, giving it instant context about all available APIs.

<Info>
We anticipate developing language-specific SDKs for our APIs in the future. If you're interested in SDKs for a particular language or framework, please <span class="white-link">[let us know](/feedback)</span>.

## SIERRA API
Use the SIERRA API if you need to invoke an LLM or generate an embedding. You can switch models by simply changing a string - we've taken care of the request body differences between models and providers. This API is fully OpenAI-compatible, so it plays nicely with tools like Obsidian and OpenCode.

## Documents Service
Use the Documents Service to convert your documents into a format that AI can easily read and understand. Simply upload images, PDFs, or Office 365 documents, and the service will convert them to markdown format. You can then use these converted files to build searchable knowledge bases that AI can query.
