## API Keys

API Keys are designed for personal scripts and applications. A single API key works across all our APIs, making it easy to get started. You can find and manage your API keys at [portal.absconsulting.com](https://portal.absconsulting.com).

To use an API key, include it in the `Api-Key` header of your requests:

```
Api-Key: your-api-key-here
```

## Bearer Tokens

Bearer tokens are used for service-to-service calls between applications. This authentication method is ideal when you need secure, automated communication between your applications and our APIs.

To use bearer tokens:

1. **Create an app registration** in the ABS Tenant
2. **Use that tenant** to obtain a bearer token
3. **Include the token** in your API requests

Our APIs verify that the bearer token is coming from an authorized application in the tenant, ensuring secure service-to-service communication.

To use a bearer token, include it in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
